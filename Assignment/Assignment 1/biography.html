          Curry is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio, at Summa Akron City Hospital, while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
          He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.
          Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups. 
          The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.

          <h5>College</h5>
          <p>
          During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season. 
          He was also a member of Toronto 5-0, a club team that plays across Ontario, pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.
          Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.

          <h5>Father</h5>
          <p>
          Wardell Stephen Curry Sr. (born June 25, 1964) is an American former professional basketball player. 
          He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1986 until 2002 
          and retired as the Charlotte Hornets' all-time leader in points (9,839) and three-point field goals made (929).
          Curry currently works as a color commentator, alongside Eric Collins, on Charlotte Hornets television broadcasts. 
          He is the father of NBA players Stephen Curry and Seth Curry.  
          </p>
          <p>
          After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference and all-state, 
          and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, 
          Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.
          He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.

            <h5>Freshman Season</h5>
            <p>
            In his first collegiate game against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. 
            Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 PPG. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. 
            Curry's scoring helped the Wildcats to a 29–5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. 
            On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-point field goal of the year, 
            breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for three-pointers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Curry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007.
            On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82–70.
            At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, 
            All-freshman team, and All-SoCon First Team.
            He was also an honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, 
            he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, 
            and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Curry became Davidson’s career leader in points and 3-pointers. 
            The Wildcats made it to the tournament in his freshman and sophomore seasons, including a magical run to the round of 8 in 2008. 
            Curry scored 40 points and made eight 3-pointers in a first-round upset of Gonzaga.
